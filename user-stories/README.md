# 📘 User Stories Directory

This directory contains the `user-stories.md` file, which outlines the functional user stories derived from the use case diagram of the ALX Airbnb Clone Project.

Each story represents a feature from the user's perspective and is intended to guide backend and frontend development, feature planning, and QA testing.
